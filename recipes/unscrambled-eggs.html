        <img src="../images/raweggs.jpeg" alt="A couple of raw eggs seasoned with a red powder inside a yellow bowl">
        <p>We are going to start with the simplest of all recipes. These are some soggy and salty spiced eggs on a bowl. This breakfast recipe is adored by children and adults alike due to its flavor and sensation in the mouth.</p>
        <p>Some people might say:"Those are just raw eggs with some spices, that's no way to have breakfast. You guys are lazy" And althought that might be true is not laziness but effectiveness what makes chef Scratch's recipes great. My only concern here is how chef Scratch is getting these eggs. There ain't no chickens on the Antartic that I know of! </p>
