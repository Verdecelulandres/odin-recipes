        <p>Here we have a delicious and rubbery lunch option, full of protein, fiber and surprisingly no ink.</p>
        <p>Now, you might be asking: "That just seems to be normal squid meat. Where does the Vegan part comes in?" and for that what I can tell you is that teh squids that Chef Scratch uses all base their diets on plant based and bacterial foods. They are considered vegan on our book.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 Squids (Vegan ones only pls)</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons of olive oil</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons of salt and pepper</li>
            <li>A handfull of garnish vegetables</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <p>The Squid meats is really rubbery and is just made to get eaten by giant blu chef penguins, so we have to make it softer.</p>
        <p>In order to do that we have to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>First hang the meat up and do a kickboxing routine on it for 5 minutes straight.</li>
            <li>Then we want to let it soak on warm water. This could take around 30 minutes</li>
            <li>While the meat is in the water we will cut out garnish and distribute it around our table</li>
            <li>On a chopping table we will proceed to slice the squid's heads and use the remains to feed your favorite kitchen helpers</li>
            <li>Season the squid heads with salt and pepper</li>
            <li>Let the heads roast on an olive oil coated skillet for 5 minutes each side</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
