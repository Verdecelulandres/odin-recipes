TOP first HTML exercise

Here I will create a simple html document regarding recipes.

I will use the elements TOP has taught me to fill this website with a couple of recipes, pages linked within the home page and making it less boring with some images trying to use relative and absolute paths for both links and images.

Hopefully it turns out to be a good and funny exercise.

Wish me luck!
